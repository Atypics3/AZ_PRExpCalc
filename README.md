# AZ_PRExpCalc
This is a calculator for Azur(e) Lane.

The purpose of this calculator is to see how much EXP remains given an initial percentage and the chosen target percentage. 

It will then calculate the amount of runs needed in order to reach that particular percentage.

More content is to be added soon.
