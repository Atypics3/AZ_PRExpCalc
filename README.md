# AZ_PRExpCalc

## About

This is a calculator for Azur(e) Lane.

The purpose of this calculator is to see how much EXP remains given an initial percentage and the chosen target percentage.

It will then calculate the amount of runs needed in order to reach that particular percentage. It will also calculate the average oil spent for those amount of runs.

## Features

- Calculation of EXP requirements for Priority and Decisive ships respectively

- Oil cost per run

Inspired by [thebombzen's EXP Calculator](https://thebombzen.moe/azur-lane/experience/).
